We present a toy version of Faust, with semantics and a small logic
for reasoning in the Coq theorem prover.

Note that this version is geared towards "educational" purposes, so it
is not usable with realistic programs.

The version for the full language ─ which is considerably more
involved ─ is in the works and will be released soon.
